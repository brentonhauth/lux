Events:
  - Hook up events

Fuctional Attributes:
  - (maybe) Change functional attributes to have '#' prefix
    - if so, change 'loop'->'#for'
  - add 'model' attribute for watching inputs

Lifecycle:
  - Design & implement global lifecycle
  - implement similar lifecycle for components
  - Add 'mounted' feature to components

Patching:
  - New patching system that doesn't rely on vnode.$el, but parent[i]
    - Check to see if dom matches vdom as updating, and patch accordingly
  - Schedule patches after getting list of updated values
  - Isolate portions of AST that need updating
  - Inject updates directly into components, to prevent full rebuild
  - (v.hard) Cancel updates
  - (unsure) Have dom watcher inform app of any foreign changes
  - Register Component as VNode to store component instance

Compiler/AST:
  - Flag static elements
  - Flag if static children
  - Keep list of watchable variables
  - Check nested elements to find recursive component use
  - Change context 'state'->'global', and 'scoped'->'scoped'
  - Have different error codes
  - Hook onError function into Compile Context
  - (unsure) Remember last used vnode(s) so you don't have to rebuild them
  - (unsure) Key elements, mainly to keep track of component un/mounting

HTML:
  - Separate html tags into different groups;
    - Band group:
      - Should not be allowed to use, or mount to
      - Contains: [
        script, noscript, style, template, html,
        body, head, title, doctype, meta, link
      ]
    - Preformated group:
      - Maintains text even if all whitespaces
      - Contains: [pre, code, ...]
  - Unpack 'dom' object (no need for it since only doing browser)
    - Keep functions for minifying and error handling

Style/CSS:
  - Implement bindable styles
  - Implement scoped css

Hyperscript:
  - Have 'h' do valid vnode checks, and the vnode ctor be a factory
  - Add component rendering to 'h' function
  - Add optional 'render' function to components, over component template
